# Microverse Project Title - Testing Practice
[Collaborative  Project]
Javascript

### Snapshot

### Introduction.

This is the sixth project in the Javascript course. By this point, the student knows how to use Objects, Object Constructors, Factory Functions, the Module Pattern, Classes, ES6 notation, and Webpack. The lesson prior to this project is an introduction to the use of Jest.

You can find the original project specification at: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice

### Project Objectives

Write tests for the following functions, and then make the tests pass!

1. capitalize(string) takes a string and returns that string with the first character capitalized.
```javascript
./capitalize/capitalize.js

const capitalize = (string) => {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.substring(1);
}
```

2. reverseString(string) takes a string and returns it reversed.
```javascript
.reserveString/reverseString.js

const capitalize = (string) => {
  return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.substring(1);
}
```

3. A calculator object that contains the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
```javascript
.calculator/calculator.js

const calculator = {
	
  add(a, b)
  subtract(a, b)
  divide(a, b)
  multiply
};

```

4. Caesar Cipher. [Read about it on this website](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/)

a. Don‚Äôt forget to test wrapping from z to a.
b. Don‚Äôt forget to test keeping the same case.
c. Don‚Äôt forget to test punctuation!
d. For this one, you may want to split the final function into a few smaller functions. One concept of Testing is that you don‚Äôt need to explicitly test every function you write‚Ä¶ Just the public ones. So in this case you only need tests for the final caesar() function. If it works as expected you can rest assured that your smaller helper functions are doing what they‚Äôre supposed to.

```javscript
./caesarCipher/caesarCipher.js

const caesarCipher = (string, move) => {
.
.
}
```

5. Array Analysis. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
```javascript
const object = analyze([1,8,3,4,2,6]);

object == {
  average: 4,
  min: 1,
  max: 8,
  length: 6
};
```


### Linter Setup

Clone file [content](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/javascript) into root directory (except for readme.md)

Install ESLint on Linux environment using the following commands

Install Node Version Manager to update NodeJS + NPM.

```sh
$curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash

$export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"

$[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

Run the following command to verify installation;

```sh
$ command -v 
nvm
```

To download, compile, and install the latest release of node, do this.

```sh
nvm install node
```

Source [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Go project folder using WSL environment and initiate NPM with following command

```sh
$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
